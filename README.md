## AIrtist
This is an experiment that tests the capabilites of Large Language Models to translate text into images. Images are represented as a grid of characters, with each character representing an individual colour.
There have been mixed results. This is not a format these models have seen or been trained on, and therefore results are extremely inconsistent and generally incoherent.

### Demo

A demo is available [here on finis.cool](https://www.finis.cool/airtist). The interface is a bit clunky and results may vary. Also please use o4 sparingly as it costs a lot !!!
